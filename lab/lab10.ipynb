    "# Question 1: Monte Carlo Policy Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "So far in class and in discussion section, we have considered the case where we have a **known** MDP and we want to solve for the value function. We've used the recursive Bellman equation to do so. For example, we can solve for the value of following a deterministic policy $\\pi$ starting from a state $s$ by using the following defintion:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ V^{\\pi}(s) = \\mathbb{E}_{s'} \\left[ R(s, \\pi(s) ,s') + \\gamma V^{\\pi}(s') \\right] = \\sum_{s'} P(s' | s, \\pi(s)) \\left( R(s, \\pi(s) ,s') + \\gamma V^{\\pi}(s') \\right) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "As long as we know $P$, $R$, and $\\pi$', we can apply value iteration to compute $V^{\\pi}(s)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this question, we will begin to explore how to do Reinforcement Learning when we **don't know** $P$ or $R$. Instead we will collect data using a fixed policy $\\pi$ and then estimate the value function directly. The simplest approach is called **Monte Carlo** policy evaluation. We collect many trajectories and then take a simple sample average. \n",
    "\n",
    "At first this might sound confusing. How do we compute a sample average for $V^{\\pi}(s)$? The righthand side requires that we know $V^{\\pi}(s)$! First, we need to introduce an equivalent but simpler way of writing the value function. It turns out that the value function is equivalent to the **average discounted sum of rewards** from running the policy $\\pi$ starting in a state $s$. For an episode that lasts for $T$ time steps, we can write mathematically:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$V^{\\pi}(s) = \\mathbb{E} \\left[ \\sum_{t=1}^T \\gamma^{t-1} R(s_t, a_t, s'_t)  \\right]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $s_1 = s$, $a_t \\sim \\pi(s_t)$, and $s'_t \\sim P(\\cdot | s_t, a_t)$. Note that the expectation is taken with respect to both the randomness in $\\pi$ (if any) and the randomness in $P$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solving this expectation mathematically using $P$, $R$, and $\\pi$ is very difficult - that's why we typically use the Bellman equation instead. But if we collect many trajectories from running $\\pi$ in the environment, then this equation is much simpler: we just take the sample average."

    "Now that we've implemented our Q-fuction update, we will define a agent that runs Q-learning in the environment. The agent will use two different exploration policies:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. greedy policy: The first type of agent always picks an action that maximizes our current estimate of the Q-function.\n",
    "2. $\\epsilon$-greedy policy: The second type picks the best estimate of the Q-function with probability $1-\\epsilon$, and picks a random action uniformly from the action space with probability $\\epsilon$. \n",

    "The first type is called a greedy agent while the second type is called an $\\epsilon$-greedy agent. Remember that taking greedy actions according to the **optimal** Q-function always results in the optimal policy.

This random exploration allows the agent to explore different actions and potentially discover higher-rewarding paths that may not have been initially apparent.

    "## Question 4. Q-learning in a stochastic setting\n",
    "Finally, let's consider the stochastic setting. In stochastic Grid World, the agent moves in its chosen direction with probability 0.8, and moves in each direction orthogonal to the direction it had meant to go in with probability 0.1. We'll consider a setting where we have a bridge that leads to a high-value end-state. However, crossing carries with it a **risk** of falling down the side of the bridge.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this simulation, we will just look at an $\\epsilon$-greedy agent with $\\epsilon = 0.3$. This time, we will observe the effects of changing the the discount factor $\\gamma$ for the Q-function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### In the cell below, test some different values of $\\gamma$ and try to find a value of $\\gamma$ that will lead the agent to try to cross the bridge and a value of $\\gamma$ that will lead the agent to take the lower valued option.\n",
    "\n",
    "There aren't any special characters to mark the bridge here, the bridge is just represented by the two blank squares with -100's on either side. The agent has a small chance of falling into a squares with -100 reward when passing through each of these \"bridge\" squares. "
